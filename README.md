Hangry is a physics-based puzzle game inspired by the classic Angry Birds. In this game, players use a slingshot to launch characters at targets to clear levels. This project was created to explore game physics, trajectory calculations, and collision detection.
🎮 How to Play
Aim: Click and drag the character back in the slingshot to set the power and angle.
Launch: Release the mouse/finger to fire the character toward the structures.
Objective: Hit and destroy all targets to win the level!
✨ Key Features
Slingshot Mechanics: Realistic pull-back and release physics.
Dynamic Gravity: Characters follow a parabolic arc once launched.
Collision System: Objects react differently based on the force and angle of impact.
Level Management: Game tracks progress and allows for level restarts.
